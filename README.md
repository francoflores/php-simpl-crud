# php-simpl-crud
This is a simple crud.

Backend is developed with PHP and MySQL as database.
Frontend was develop with jQuery, ajax, boostrap, datatables and Material Icons.
To comunicate between both I used Rest API.

**How to started**

Just is neccesary to make this few steps.

1. Create database.
2. Put project on a web server with PHP 7.0 or greater and MySQL.
3. Update database config on **/database/Connection.php** .
4. Execute script migration **php database/migration.php** from the project root.
5. Open project on web browser.

PD: If you have problems with migration script, you can use SQL file on database/restore.sql to test web site.
